## There's a couple of other ways you can play with Tailwind CSS. Let's take a look at those options.

# CDN

```html
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

Another way to play with Tailwind CSS is to use their CDN link.

Notice that this isn't a stylesheet, but a special JavaScript file hosted on a Content Delivery Network. The JavaScript file does something similar to what the build process does.

It analyzes the file that calls it and looks for places with Tailwinds CSS code. It then dynamically creates styles based on that assessment using javascript.

This lets you create your own demos on sites like CodePen or using plugins like CodeSwing.
