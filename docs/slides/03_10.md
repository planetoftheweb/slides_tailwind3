Alright, it's time for some practice.

Let's try using some of what we've learned to create a mixin that will help us generate badges for our site.

I want to make sure you use maps to create a set of color options for the badges.

There should be a hover color that uses SASS color functions

You should also use conditionals that allow for a version of the badges that is more rounded. We'll call those pills.

Use the each statement to navigate through the maps and create the badge styles
