# Parent Selector

> >

The parent selector lets you easily work with nested styles to choose the parent of a current class. It's a brilliant idea.

# Parent Selector

```scss
.btn {
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background: #444;

  &:hover {
    background: #800;
  }

  &-primary {
    background: #3ab5e9;
  }

  .container & {
    text-align: right;
  }
}
```

- Ampersand `&`
- Copies parent
- Use as a suffix
- Target parent present

In a nested rule, you can use the ampersand to create classes that target the parent in some way.

The ampersand copies the parent selector and can allow you to add a rule.

You can use this to create an alternative class that has a suffix at the end of the selector.

You can even create a class that depends on wether a specific parent exists.

This gives you an extremely flexible set of rules that can help you cover all types os scenarios.
