Let's take a look at how we can use a popular build tool called Vite to create an environment to work on Sass.

---

# Vite Installation

```bash
npm init vite@latest
...m
cd sassEssentials
npm install
```

# Sass Installation

```
npm install -D sass
```

- Rename `style.scss`
- Modify `main.js`

```
npm run dev
```

After you install sass, you'll need to modify a few things. Right now, the stylesheet that is being loaded is coming from our style.css file.

I need to rename that file to style.scss and then modify the main.js file so that it imports the new file.

```scss
$bg: #ead2a8;

body {
  background: $bg;
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
  max-width: 80vw;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

To make sure that everything works, I'm going to make some changes to the css. We'll create a sass variable called `$bg` and then set it to a beige color. Then, I'll set the background color of the body to that color.

I'll also modify the main.js so that it only imports the CSS and nothing else.

Then, I'll add some basic HTML to the page.

```html
