# Placeholder Selectors

> >

Sometimes, you want to create a class that is not really something you want to compile, but only something that you only want to extend, in that case you can use placeholder selectors.

---

# Placeholders

```
%btn {
  background: #444;
  color: white;
  // ...
}

.btn-primary {
  @extend %btn;
  background: #3ab5e9;
}
.btn-secondary {
  @extend %btn;
  background: orange;
}
```

- `%NAME`
- `@extend %NAME`

To create a placeholder selector, you use the percentage sign with the variable name.

Of course to use it, you use the extend at rule with the name of the variable.
