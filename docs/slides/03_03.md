It's pretty popular to add comments to let people know what's going on with your code. SASS comments have a few interesting features.

# Comments

```
/* Regular CSS -- Published */
/* Multi Line
    Comments -- Published */
// JavaScript Style -- Unpublished
/*! Force publish this one */

$color: #3ab5e9;
/* Interpolate: #{$color} */
```

- Can use CSS Comments
- JavaScript Unpublished
- Force Publish Compressed
- Interpolation OK

Of course, you can use CSS style comments. These are normally published, unless you specify compressed CSS output in your options.

You can of course create multi-line comments just like in CSS.

There's an option to use JavaScript style double slash comments. The nice thing is that these will not be published in any mode once they are processed. That's nice because you can add developer comments others won't see.

Another interesting feature in comments is that you can use variable interpolation within them and output the results of expressions directly in you comments. Pretty awesome.
