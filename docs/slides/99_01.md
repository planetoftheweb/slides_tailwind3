Thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed the course. We have a lot more content on both Git and Github, including deep dives and more advanced concepts from some great teachers like Kevin Skoglund and courses from people who work at Github.

If you want to keep up with what I'm up to, you can follow me just about anywhere at @planetoftheweb, look for the livestreams I do here on LinkedIn or check out my blog at raybo.org.

See you next time!
