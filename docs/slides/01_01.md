Browsers do not understand SASS directly, so you need to use a set of tools to convert SASS to CSS. That's pretty common in Web Development, so let's go over what you'll need for a typical setup.

---

# Requirements

- NPM [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version>=12
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/) (Optional)
- Terminal App ([Hyper](https://hyper.is))
- Build ([Vite](https://vitejs.dev/))
- Code Editor ([VSCode](https://vscode.dev/))
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) Module

Most developers use NPM, the Node Package Manager, which part of a utility called Node.js. It lets you install modules, which are like utilities that add functionality to your project.

You're going to need to have Git, which you can get at this URL as well as a GitHub account. If you're on a PC, when you install Git, you may want to also install Git Bash, which is a shell that lets you run linux commands.

You'll also need a terminal application. If you're on a PC, you can use GitBash and on a Mac, the Mac Terminal. I often use Hyper, which you can get from this URL.

You'll also need a build tool. This is what will process your SASS into CSS. I use Vite, which you can get from this URL.

Of course, you'll need a code editor. I use VS Code, which you can get from this URL.

Finally, you're going to need Sass itself. This installs as a node module.

# Vite Installation

```bash
npm init vite@latest
...
cd sassEssentials
npm install
```

---

# Sass Installation

```
npm install -D sass
```

- Rename `style.scss`
- Modify `main.js`

```
npm run dev
```

After you install sass, you'll need to modify a few things. Right now, the stylesheet that is being loaded is coming from our style.css file.

I need to rename that file to style.scss and then modify the main.js file so that it imports the new file.

```scss
$bg: #ead2a8;

body {
  background: $bg;
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
  max-width: 80vw;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

To make sure that everything works, I'm going to make some changes to the css. We'll create a sass variable called `$bg` and then set it to a beige color. Then, I'll set the background color of the body to that color.

I'll also modify the main.js so that it only imports the CSS and nothing else.

Then, I'll add some basic HTML to the page.

```html
