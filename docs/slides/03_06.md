The for at rule gives you a way to iterate through a series of numbers, which can be useful.

---

# @for

- Counts up or down
- `@for <var> to|through <expression>` { ... }

```
$font-size: (3rem, 2.5rem, 2rem);

@for $i from 1 through length($font-size) {
  h#{$i} {
    font-size: nth($font-size, $i);
  }
}
```

The for loop lets you count up or down through a series of numbers

You use the @for at rule, then specify a number and the keywords to or through and then an expression

If you use through, then it includes the last number, if you use to, then it doesn't

Here's a cool way, for example you could reset the size of your headline tags.
