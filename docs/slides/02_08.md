Alright, it's time for some practice.

Let's try using some of what we've learned to create a mixin that will help us generate a series of related message classes.

We'll make sure our mixin has a default value for a background color

And that we're using nested styles to make it easier to define our classes.

Be sure to add a hover state so that when we roll over a message, it highlights in some way.

Use the parent selector to help you build a variant of the main message classes called info.

I've given you some code to get started, which you can see right here.

When you're done, it should look something like this.
