SASS allows you to nest rules inside other rules, which makes organizing complex rules easier.

This is one of the best features in sass that as of the recording of this course, haven't been yet added to CSS. It combines rules and helps organize them a bit.

However, you must be careful because a lot of nesting will create a lot of extra CSS, which can get quite complex.

Since SASS is compiled, a lot of nested rules can also mean that the CSS will take longer to generate, so you should try, as much as possible to keep your rules simpler.
