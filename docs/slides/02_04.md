Another key feature in Sass is the ability to create separate files with snippets of code that can be easily imported into other files.

# SASS Partials

```scss
// _variables.scss
$bg: #ead2a8;
$primary: SlateBlue;

//_base.scss
@use "variables";
body {
  background: variables.$bg;
  ...
}

//style.scss
@use "variables" as var;
@use "base";
h1 {
  color: var.$primary;
}
```

- start with an underscore `_`
- @use copies code
- Namespaced variables
- use `as` shortcut

Another fantastic feature is the ability to import bits of code into other code. This lets you organize your CSS into different files.

To do this, you create some files that start with an underscore, a name and then an extension. The underscore lets sass know that it shouldn't process the file as a separate css document.

Then you can use the use keyword to import those snippets into other files.
