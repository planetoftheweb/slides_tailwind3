Interpolation in SASS lets you work with variables that are defined by expressions.

# Interpolation

- `#{}`
- Calculations
- Lots of places

```
@mixin btn($name: "", $bg: #444, $col: white) {
  .btn#{$name} {
    background: $bg;
    color: $col;
    // ...
  }
}
@include btn;
@include btn("-primary", #3ab5e9);
```

You can create an expresion by using a hashtag and curly braces. It's similar to what you can do with JavaScript except of course that we don't use the dollar sign because in Sass we're already using that for variables.

Alghough this example is pretty simple, you can use it to output a calculation, not just a variable name.

Expressions can be used in a variety of places, not just mixins, but also comments, function names, extends, @ rules and more.
