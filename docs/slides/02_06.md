# SASS Mixins

SASS also lets you do something similar to JavaScript functions. These are called mixins and are super flexible.

# SASS Mixins

```scss
@mixin btn($col: #444) {
  background: $col;
  border-radius: 5px;
  ...
}

.btn {
  @include btn;
}

.btn-primary {
  @include btn($col: #3ab5e9);
  color: yellow;
}

```

- Create with `@mixin`
- Pass arguments
- Set defaults
- Use `@include`

You create one with the mixin at rule.

You can pass along as many arguments as you need and even have a trailing comma at the end.

When you pass an argument, you can also include a default value. The arguments can be passed either by order or by name, so the name of the argument isn't required.

To work with the arguments, you use an `@include` at rule.
