One of the ways that Sass is superior to CSS is in the rich color functions provided for you.

# Color Utilities

- `@use "sass:color"`
- `color.adjust()`
- `darken()`, `lighten()`
- `transparentize()`

```scss
@use "sass:color";
$color: cyan;
/* #{ color.adjust($color, $lightness: -20, $alpha: .4)} */
/* #{transparentize($color, .9)} */
/* #{lighten($color, 30%)} */
/* #{darken($color, 20%)} */
```

The color modules, like math is extremely large, so I'm just including some of my favorite ways to modify colors here, make sure you check the documentation for the complete list.

Start off by adding it to your library use the use at rule, then you cna use the color functions.

One of the best is the color.adjust() method, which is the most flexible way to change a color.

However, you can also target things like the transparency of a color, darken or lighten a color and much much more.

This is one that you're going to want to try and check out in the manual and then give it a shot using something like CodePen.
