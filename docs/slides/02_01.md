# Syntax Versions

There are in fact two different flavors of SASS, although most people use the newer format, let's examine the basic differences.

---

# SASS Format

- `.sass` (indented)
- No punctuation
- Meaningful whitespace

```sass
$bg: #ead2a8

body
  background: $bg
```

> >

The older format has a .sass extension.

This format gets rid of a lot of the punctuation in sass, so some people consider it an easier way to write sass.

The key thing about this format is that whitespace is meaningful, so you end up indenting with tabs or spaces whenever you'd type in curly braces.

You also don't need the ending semicolons.

# SCSS Format

- `.scss` (Sassy)
- CSS compatible
- Most popular

```scss
$bg: #ead2a8;

body {
  background: $bg;
}
```

> >

The second format has the .scss extension.

It's more compatible than SASS, but it does have the same punctuation that CSS has, so it can take longer to write.

This is by far the most common and popular format. We'll be focusing on the scss format on this course.
