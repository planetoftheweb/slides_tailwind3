Now that we understand variables and how to access them, let's talk about some of the ways you can access them, starting with the each at rule

---

# @each

- Emit styles
- `@each <var> in <expression>` { ... }
- Destructuring

```
@mixin btn($name: "", $bg: #444, $col: white) {
  .btn#{$name} {
    background: $bg;
    color: $col;
    // ...
  }
}

$buttons:
  -primary #3ab5e9 hotpink,
  -secondary green yellow;

@each $name, $bg, $col in $buttons {
  @include btn($name, $bg, $col);
}
```

The each statements allows you to emit a number of styles based on a list or a map.

You use an at rule with a variable to use for each statements as you navigation through an expression. The expression is usually a list or something that computes to a list like some of the methods we saw in the previous video.

You can also use destructuring so that you can create a series of variables from a complex list.

The each at rule is pretty powerful and makes list a dream to work with.
